This project explores how to use ScalaJS and Containeriszation to build an image processing plattforrm that is based on a DSL that composes steps and optimizes their execustion plan based on registered resources. 
The first woring example is backend/src/test/scala/action/ActionTest.scala that uses the blazeface tensorflow model to anonymize a picture by blurring the faces in it.
